I eventually settled on Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course 6), exploring my interests in signal processing, machine learning and data structures, and trying to apply them to problems in linguistics, physics, and imaging (right now I'm working on algorithms to automatically take the blur out of your photographs!). Every few months I become mildly obsessed with something new, ranging from making documentaries to engineering biological circuits. I love being in an environment where I can always find someone to teach me all about whatever arbitrary thing happens to pique my curiosity, and am very excited about Spokes as a way to give students a taste of that intense intellectual environment and connect them to mentors in large technical communities.</p></div><div class="hidden" id="bruno"><h3>Bruno Faviero<small class="pull-right">MIT Class of 2015</small></h3><p>I am a sophomore at MIT, but a lifelong underclassman. I love learning new things: writing techniques, sailing strategies, Ultimate throws, design concepts — anything interesting! I also love teaching, and currently tutor Algorithms and TA a public speaking class. Lately, I've enjoyed learning about Computer Science (my major) and design — two subjects I am very passionate about! I am excited about Spokes because I want to help get kids motivated to learn and do things, because I believe there is so much unlocked potential in everyone that could be easily brought out with engaging ...I was born in Brazil, moved to Florida at 7, and moved to MIT at 18. I'm currently a News Editor at <a href='http://tech.mit.edu'>The Tech</a> and Director of <a href='http://www.startlabs.org'>StartLabs</a>. In the spare time I don't have, I enjoy sailing, running, scuba diving, photographing, and other sundry activities.</p></div><div class="hidden" id="claire"><h3>Claire O'Connell<small class="pull-right">MIT Class of 2013</small></h3><p>Claire is a graduating junior at MIT studying Brain & Cognitive Science. She was born in England, lived in France until the age of 8 when she moved to Palo Alto, CA, where she lived until leaving for MIT . She is a dual citizen of the UK and Canada, and now calls her "home-base" Shanghai, China, where her parents moved in 2010. She is currently working as the director of educational outreach at <a href='http://eyewire.org'>EyeWire</a>, a citizen science initiative that she cofounded during January of 2011. In her spare time, she loves running with her teammates on the MIT cross country and track teams, competing in the 3k steeplechase, and traveling absolutely anywhere! She believes that there is a profound connection between education and cognition, and aims to spend her life discovering that connection and using it to change global education. And she loves smiley faces. A lot. :)</p></div><div class="hidden" id="ethan"><h3>Ethan Sherbondy<small class="pull-right">MIT Class of 2014</small></h3><p>I'm a Junior studying Computer Science at MIT. I love plants, honeybees, and computer graphics. I made the website that you're staring at right now. I am ceaselessly amazed by the power of the Internet and the World Wide Web to spread information and connect people.</p><p>I grew up surrounded by trees in Raleigh, North Carolina. I've been writing software since I was a wee lad, and I hope to share the wonders of programming with the world.</p></div><div class="hidden" id="jeff"><h3>Jeff Prouty<small class="pull-right">MIT Class of 2014</small></h3><p>I am a current junior at MIT majoring in physics.  I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and moved to Charlotte, North Carolina when I was nine.  I'm a runner (and now a biker!), I play the guitar (and whatever else I can get my hands on), and I enjoy creative writing and making electronic music.  I also love teaching and taught an AP Physics course to local high school students last year.  My career goals are pretty open at this point, but my current plan is to study physics in grad school.  When I figure out how the universe works I'll let you know.</p></div><div class="hidden" id="nathan"><h3>Nathan Kit Kennedy<small class="pull-right">UC Berkeley Class of 2014</small></h3><p>I am a senior at UC Berkeley studying a passion of mine, film. I have always been a story teller, whether it be through a simple drawing of a cartoonish character, a live performance on stage, or merely retelling a good tale to a group of friends. The fantastic medium of film combines every aspect of those forms of story telling, allowing me to express myself fully. The other element of film that I have fallen in love with is people. This artform requires working with people, and lots of em. Working with a group of enthusiastic individuals towards a creative goal and witnessing the vision come to life is a truly gratifying experience. </p><p>That is why this trip is so important to me. It is an incredible opportunity to work with a group of incredible people in order to tell their story. </p></div><div class="hidden" id="phillip"><h3>Phillip Daniel<small class="pull-right">MIT Class of 2013</small></h3><p>I am a senior in the Mechanical Engineering department at MIT, with aspirations of improving the world. I was raised in Durham, North Carolina and I enjoy building things, learning about entrepreneurship in Boston's entrepreneurial ecosystem, biking, and playing my trombone. In the short term, I plan to attend graduate school to study design and product development. Down the road, I plan to start a company and give entrepreneurship a shot. If things don't work out there, I will find a job at a product design firm and live like a normal person, sleeping 8 hours every day.</p></div><div class="hidden" id="turner"><h3>Turner Bohlen<small class="pull-right">MIT Class of 2014</small></h3><p>I am a junior at MIT majoring in Physics, and pursuing interests in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I have lived in towns all along cthe east coast, but think of myself as having grown up in Southborough, MA. Now, Washington, DC, where my parents recently moved, is home. I have had more hobbies and interests than I can count, but have more recently focused on entrepreneurship, innovation, and education. I directed the wonderful StartLabs team, which is dedicated to providing MIT engineers and scientists with the resources necessary to start world-changing companies, for the last year, during which we did some fantastic work interweaving the Boston and MIT communitees. I am currently working with three others to develop a cheap 3D scanning technology, and am searching hard for a way to teach every person worldwide that they, too, can find a passion (or three).
